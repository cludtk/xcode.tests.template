The default Xcode 4.x project templates are located in the Xcode.app bundle. For Mac apps they are here:
<b>Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/</b>

For iOS app they are here:
<b>Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/</b>

For custom templates, you're best to add them to your local library:
<b>~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/</b> so that when you update Xcode it doesn't delete them all on you.
